# Fitpay iOS SDK - README.md


## Using the SDK
Fitpay distributes the SDK via cocoapods. Documentation on using cocoapods can be found [here](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html). Once you have set up your project to use cocoapods, add the following to your Podfile:
```ruby
pod 'FitpaySDK'
```


## Building the SDK locally
Ensure you have cocoapods installed, and the repo checked out:
```shell
sudo gem install cocoapods  
cd ~  
mkdir fitpay
cd fitpay  
git clone git@github.com:fitpay/fitpay-ios-sdk.git
cd fitpay-ios-sdk
pod install  
```
Open XCode, and add a project (->Open another project->/users/yourname/fipay/fitpay-ios-sdk)  

Fit-Pay also utilizes a continuous integration system (travis) to build and test. Current Develop Branch Status: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fitpay/fitpay-ios-sdk.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/fitpay/fitpay-ios-sdk)


## Running Tests Locally from XCode UI
Open the project inside of XCode
Filemenu -> View, Navigators, Show Test Navigators
Right click on FitpaySDK tests, Enable tests
Click on a test, and press "Play"

## Running Tests From the Commandline
By default the tests will run in the iPhone 6s simulator.
```
./bin/test
```
To test on a different simulator, pass in a valid simulator same.
```
./bin/test "iPhone 5s"
```



## Contributing to the SDK
We welcome contributions to the SDK. For your first few contributions please fork the repo, make your changes and submit a pull request. Internally we branch off of develop, test, and PR-review the branch before merging to develop (moderately stable). Releases to Master happen less frequently, undergo more testing, and can be considered stable.
